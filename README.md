## Introduction

FlaskSiteBuilder was inspired by the need to simplify and enhance the development experience for Flask applications. This project is aimed at individuals, freelancers, small businesses, and non-profit organizations who want to build and manage websites with Pythonic simplicity. The landing page showcases the key features and provides information about the project.

## Features

### Feature 1: Secure User Authentication
The FlaskSiteBuilder project includes a robust user authentication system that ensures secure access to your application. This feature provides user registration, login, logout, and password reset functionalities. By leveraging Flask extensions like Flask-Login, Flask-WTF, and Flask-Bcrypt, the authentication system ensures that user credentials are handled securely, including hashing passwords before storing them in the database. The authentication system also includes email verification for new users, enhancing the security and trustworthiness of your application.

### Feature 2: Modular Code Structure
One of the standout features of FlaskSiteBuilder is its modular code structure, which promotes maintainability and scalability. The project is organized into distinct modules for different components, such as authentication, main routes, static files, templates, and utilities. This separation of concerns makes it easier to manage and expand the application as new features are added. Developers can work on individual modules without interfering with the rest of the codebase, leading to more efficient development and debugging processes.

### Feature 3: Responsive Design
FlaskSiteBuilder is designed with a mobile-first approach, ensuring that your application looks and functions beautifully on any device. The responsive design feature adapts the layout to various screen sizes, from desktops to smartphones. Utilizing modern CSS techniques and frameworks like Bootstrap, the project provides a consistent and user-friendly experience across different devices. This feature not only enhances the usability of the application but also improves its accessibility, making it available to a broader audience.
